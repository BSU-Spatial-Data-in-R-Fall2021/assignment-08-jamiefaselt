## Your assignment

The goals for this assignment are to:

- practice making maps with the various packages
- think about composition and the grammar of graphics
- critique various maps

_By the end of the assignment_ you should have several static maps displaying the datasets we've used in the last few weeks.

# Task 1: Show me your ugly maps!!
Find 2 examples of maps that you think are 'bad'. 

![badmap1](badmap2.png)
![badmap2](badmap1.jpg)

_Question 1_ Why are they bad? What might improve them? 
The first map is trying to do way too much. My interpretation is that it has taken three datasets, high school graduates, college graduates, and median household income. The infographic then combines the colors for each county. While looking at the relationship of educational attainment and income has merit as a question, combining the data in this way was not an effective way to show that relationship. It is also not clear that the county level was any more interesting than say the state level. One option to improve could have been creating a ratio of education to income and normalizing that with one color scheme so places could more readily be compared to one another.


_Question 2_ Rely on the Healy and Wilke texts to provide some structure to your answers.
The second map (as well as the first) goes against the rule of proportional ink, the symbols are giant and its just one big blob of grey. You don't get any information from this other than a takeaway that Belgium has a lot of churches, which isn't particularly interesting. 

__MW: These are terrible. I couldn't even tell where the second map was because all of the landmarks were obscured. In the first map, something like a bivariate map rather than this weird blend might have been helpful.

# Task 2: Load your libraries and build a dataframe
You can choose whichever datasets you'd like from the past several months as the subject for your mapping. You'll need to use at least one tabular join, one spatial join, and one extraction to create the dataframe. Load the packages, the data, and make sure everything is projected here. Give me a sense for what you are hoping to map.

```{r, echo=FALSE} 
r <- terra::rast("temp_rstr.tif") #using my template raster for research -- lol jk this is causing all sorts of issues
landval <- terra::rast("landvalrastmt.tif") #needed to get a different state and I had to crop the file from the boston lab to mt #incorrect pathname and no way to track whether you did this cropping correctly. 

mammal.rich <- rast("/opt/data/session16/Mammals_total_richness.tif")
hmi <- rast("/opt/data/session08/hmi.tif")
mammal.rich <- catalyze(mammal.rich)
mammal.rich <- mammal.rich[[2]]

pas.desig <- st_read("/opt/data/session04/regionalPAs1.shp")
pas.proc <- st_read("/opt/data/session16/reg_pas.shp")

colnames(pas.proc)[c(1, 6, 8, 10, 12, 22, 25)] <- colnames(pas.desig) #find the columnames in the proc dataset and replace them with the almost matching names from the des.

gap.sts <- c("1", "2", "3") 
pas <- pas.proc %>% 
  select(., colnames(pas.desig)) %>% 
  bind_rows(pas.desig, pas.proc) %>%  #select the columns that match and then combine
  filter(., State_Nm == "MT" & GAP_Sts %in% gap.sts ) %>% st_make_valid() %>% st_buffer(., 10000)
#Buffering here to deal with some of the linear features along rivers

```

Bring in a map of Montana and match our projections
```{r}
mt <- tigris::states(cb=TRUE) %>% 
  filter(STUSPS == "MT") 

# make spatvectors
st_crs(mammal.rich)$proj4string
pa.vect <- as(pas, "SpatVector")
mt.vect <- as(mt, "SpatVector")

# project to match mammal richness
pa.vect <- project(pa.vect, mammal.rich)
mt.vect <- project(mt.vect, mammal.rich)
land.val.proj <- project(landval, mammal.rich)
hmi.proj <- project(hmi, mammal.rich)

#crop to match montana
mam.rich.crop <- crop(mammal.rich, mt.vect)
mt.val.crop <- crop(land.val.proj, mt.vect)
hmi.crop <- crop(hmi.proj, mt.vect)

plot(mam.rich.crop)
plot(mt.vect, add=TRUE)
plot(pa.vect, add=TRUE)
```

Add some tidy census variables
```{r}
mt.income <- tidycensus:: get_acs(geography = "county", 
              variables = c(medianincome = "B19013_001", # I tried pretty hard to get this to be % poverty but kept getting errors :(
                            pop = "B01003_001"),
              state = c("MT"), 
              year = 2018,
              key = key,
              geometry = TRUE) %>% 
                st_transform(., crs(mammal.rich)) %>% 
  select(-moe) %>% 
  spread(variable, estimate)
#your key is mising
```

let's see if I can get this to work with poverty data...
```{r}
mt.poverty <- tidycensus:: get_acs(geography = "county", 
              variables = c(family_poverty = "B17010_002", 
                            pop = "B01003_001"),
              state = c("MT", "WY"), 
              year = 2018,
              key = key,
              geometry = TRUE) %>% 
                st_transform(., crs(mammal.rich)) %>% 
  select(-moe) %>% 
  spread(variable, estimate)


reg.poverty <- st_make_valid(mt.poverty)

pa.summary.pov<- st_join(st_as_sf(pa.vect), mt.poverty, join = st_overlaps)

pa.summary.pov <- pa.summary.pov %>% 
  group_by(Unit_Nm) %>% 
  summarize(., family_poverty = mean(family_poverty, na.rm=TRUE),
            meanpop = mean(pop, na.rm=TRUE))
#double check to see that I got the right number of rows
nrow(pa.summary.pov) ==length(unique(pas$Unit_Nm))
## [1] TRUE

```

Run zonal statistics
```{r}
pa.zones <- terra::rasterize(pa.vect, mam.rich.crop, field = "Unit_Nm")
mammal.zones <- terra::zonal(mam.rich.crop, pa.zones, fun = "mean", na.rm=TRUE)
hmi.zones <- terra::zonal(hmi.crop, pa.zones, fun = "mean", na.rm=TRUE)
landval.zones <- terra::zonal(mt.val.crop, pa.zones, fun = "mean", na.rm=TRUE)
#Note that there is one few zone than we have in our PA dataset. This is because we have an overlapping jurisdicition; we'll ingnore that now but it's a common problemen with using the PADUS

summary.df.pov <- pa.summary.pov %>% 
  left_join(., mammal.zones) %>% 
  left_join(., landval.zones) %>% 
  left_join(., hmi.zones)

```


Extract and put everything together into one df
```{r}
pa.summary.income <- st_join(st_as_sf(pa.vect), mt.income, join = st_overlaps)

pa.summary.income <- pa.summary.income %>% 
  group_by(Unit_Nm) %>% 
  summarize(., meaninc = mean(medianincome, na.rm=TRUE),
            meanpop = mean(pop, na.rm=TRUE))
#double check to see that I got the right number of rows
nrow(pa.summary.income) ==length(unique(pas$Unit_Nm))
## [1] TRUE
pa.zones <- terra::rasterize(pa.vect, mam.rich.crop, field = "Unit_Nm")
mammal.zones <- terra::zonal(mam.rich.crop, pa.zones, fun = "mean", na.rm=TRUE)
hmi.zones <- terra::zonal(hmi.crop, pa.zones, fun = "mean", na.rm=TRUE)
landval.zones <- terra::zonal(mt.val.crop, pa.zones, fun = "mean", na.rm=TRUE)
#Note that there is one few zone than we have in our PA dataset. This is because we have an overlapping jurisdicition; we'll ingnore that now but it's a common problement with using the PADUS

summary.df.inc <- pa.summary.income %>% 
  left_join(., mammal.zones) %>% 
  left_join(., landval.zones) %>% 
  left_join(., hmi.zones)

colnames(summary.df.inc)
```



# Task 3: Build a map with Tmap
Practice making a quick map with tmap. 

```{r}
tm_shape(mam.rich.crop) +
  tm_raster("Value", palette = viridis(n=50), n=50, legend.show=FALSE, legend.hist = TRUE, legend.hist.title = "Species Richness") +
tm_shape(mt) +
  tm_borders("white", lwd = .75) +
tm_shape(summary.df.inc) +
  tm_polygons(col = "meaninc",  border.col = "white", title="Mean Income") + 
  tm_legend(outside = TRUE)

```


# Task 4: Build a choropleth with ggplot
Your map should have a basemap, should rely on more than one aesthetic (color, transparency, etc), and combine multiple layers.

```{r}
ggplot(summary.df.pov) +
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = family_poverty)) +
  geom_sf(data=mt, fill=NA,color="black")

ggplot(summary.df.inc) +
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = meaninc)) +
  geom_sf(data=mt, fill=NA,color="black")

```

chloroplath 
```{r}
bg <- ggmap::get_map(as.vector(st_bbox(mt))) # basemap

ggmap(bg) +
   geom_sf(data = summary.df.pov, mapping = aes(fill = family_poverty), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_sf(data=mt, fill=NA,color="black", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4326))

ggmap(bg) +
  geom_sf(data = summary.df.pov, mapping = aes(fill = Value, 
                                           alpha = (landvalrastmtwy - max(landvalrastmtwy, na.rm=TRUE))/(max(landvalrastmtwy, na.rm=TRUE)-min(landvalrastmtwy, na.rm = TRUE))), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_sf(data=mt, fill=NA,color="black", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option="magma")+
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4326))
```

__MW: As is indicated by the warnings and the resulting map, there is a problem with the way you calculated the alpha resulting in a map that has only one functioning aesthetic (instead of the two requested in the instructions.)

# Task 5: Build 2 cartograms
Follow the examples to build cartograms that display your region of interest based on variables other than area.

```{r}
mt.pop <- cartogram_cont(mt.income, "pop", itermax = 5)

mt.inc <- cartogram_cont(mt.income, "medianincome", itermax = 5)

mt.pov <- cartogram_cont(mt.poverty, "family_poverty", itermax = 5)

# cartogram based on population
tm_shape(mt.pop) + tm_polygons("pop", style = "jenks", title="Population") +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.position = c("left", "bottom")) 

# cartogram based on median income
tm_shape(mt.inc) + tm_polygons("medianincome", style = "jenks", title="Median Household Income") +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.position = c("left", "bottom")) 

# cartogram based on family poverty
tm_shape(mt.pov) + tm_polygons("family_poverty", style = "jenks", title = "Family Poverty Rates") +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.position = c("left", "bottom")) 

```




_Question 3:_ Reflect on the different maps you've made, what do the different visualizations tell you about the data you plotted?
Base on the data plotted, Montana has higher species richness in the western part of the state and that income in areas surrounding PAs also appears to be higher for the western part of the state. Poverty rates also seemed to follow that same trend. 

_Question 4:_ How might you improve the maps you've made?
I am not sure if I did the baseplot map incorrectly but I found that one the least interesting. Visualizing the data in that way made it seem like being a protected area was the function of poverty, but it would be more interesting to see that if it is a regional thing or truly something correlated to PA status. I would also change the color to be on a red-orange scale since my mind biases blue towarsd something positive which family poverty is not. With more time I would have also created maps to compare things like HMI instead of just land value.

__MW: Your answer highlights an important challenge with maps. You've interpreted the map as if poverty causes protected areas, another person might see the same map and say protected areas drive poverty (this is a common argument, actually). Maps can't tell us much about causation on their own,only patterns leaving us to tell ourselves stories colored by our own experiences and worldviews. Accompanying maps with actual analysis can help, but even then there are issues.__

_Question 5:_ Is a map the best way to evaluate the data you worked with? Why or Why not?
I think using maps was pretty appropriate for the purposes of this assignment. I was not as impressed with overlaying the data with the opaque blocks such as the species richness poverty maps. These cartograms were more interesting and straight forward to interpret than some of the earlier maps and overall this assignment is useful for assessing some intiial potential trends but looking at more mathematical relationships and visualizing things that way could provide more meaningful data.
